### WHY? 
 By default chirpstack is airing in cleartext + captured in easy MITM
 Let's fix it.

 Other generic browser encryption certs may display confusing errors: .onion = security
 .onions are resistant to MITM attacks (Man in the Middle) using end to end between tor clients

 This script creates secure encryption keys + new .onion Tor Hidden Service Address
 
 Offering an end-to-end encryption option for secure Chirpstack LoRaWAN administration

### BENEFITS:
 * No MITM attacks on Chirpstack .onion
 * NAT punch: no need to change your firewall rules! 
 + no open ports - admin worldwide - securely

 Optional: block/reject outside localhost for .onion only access
 (hidden service only needs connection through localhost)
